To gain insights about the physical structure of protein domains, a Potts model is trained to represent pairwise statistical dependencies between amino-acids. For the first time, this Direct Coupling Analysis is performed within the framework of Imperatively Defined Factor Graphs. This enables the usage of the probabilistic programming framework Factorie. After laying out the problems of a maximum-likelihood based approach, the training is performed using Contrastive Divergence. The Contrastive Divergence gradients are used with the AdaGrad Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm. To induce sparsity on the pairwise parameter estimate l1-regularization performed via Regularized Dual Averaging. The results are compared to a na√Øve mutual information based analysis.
